generate summary:
Based on our topic and related organization that we are eager to discuss in our project, we are trying to find tighter connection between all the variables. Has liquor sales influenced by the income in different counties and cities? Is the level of income also related to the level of education and the percentage of ethnicity? How does the type of wine relate to total wine sales? In looking at these datasets, we tend to combine statistical analysis with social factors.
